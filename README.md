# reinstall-challenge
Ridiculous tracking of reinstalls (nuke-n-pave) throughout the years to better myself.

## The Beginning
Initially a challenge by [roguewhaler](https://roguewhaler.net/) and [otherjared](https://otherjared.net/) in 2012 to keep the number of OS reinstalls per computer down to 5 per year.

## The Now
I am continuing to keep track of just how ridiculous I am and attempting to better myself. Each reinstall referenced here is a complete [nuke n pave](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nuke%20n%20pave). Point updates and standard maintenance updates are not tracked.

## Progress
